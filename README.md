- Accepts memory descriptions (e.g. `Tell me about my daughter's first birthday party`) as prompt input using Streamlit's `st.text_area()`, then assign this to the `memory_description` variable.
- LLM model is called via `llm()` and it is applied on the prompt input `memory_description` to generate enriched and detailed narratives via `llm(memory_description)`
